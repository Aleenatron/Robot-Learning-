# Robot-Learning

This is the starting of understanding Reinforcement Learning and getting a grasp over Pytorch framework by doing tutorials and lab assignments and mini projects. The goal of these mini projects is to gain more clarity so as to develop test cases for benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous vehciles in high fidelity simulators like CARLA.

# Duration of Projects 
3 months

# Milestons
1. Set up nautilius
2. Complete pytorch tutorials and all the lab assignemnts in this [course](https://alex-mitrevski.com/robot-learning.html)
3. Proper understanding of DRIVE-SIM and SIM2Real from this [paper](https://github.com/Aleenatron/Robot-Learning-/blob/main/resources/main_640862.pdf)
4. Try implementing the paper in CARLA simulator
5. Refine your understanding and key takeaways in a project report and come up with a research proposal for the Spring quarter
